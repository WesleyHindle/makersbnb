Requests

"Requests I've made:"

##Use the spaceid FK to get the corresponding spacename 

post '/requests' do 
      @guestrequests = Requests.guest(userid) # Returns all dtaes users have requested
          def intitialize
            spaceid, check in, approved, space name
          end
          
          def guest do 
            
          end 

      @hostrequests = Requests.host(userid) # Returns all dates you have requested
      erb :request
end

Guest requests                               |     Host requests
@guestrequests.each do |date|                |    @hostrequests.each do  |date |
  display date                               |      display date
end                                          |    end 
space name  |   check in  | approved?        |    space name  |   check in  | approved?

  ##Will need to amend requests table to inc approved column


#Using the user ID it should query the table for any requests and return them to 
the requests page
  - In the controller do a post request which takes the user ID as the param and queries
    select * from requests where guests == userid
  - This would then display check in date and whether the request has been approved or not

    



These should then be rendered in the requests I've made section


When looking at requests made for on of your property
 - In the controller do a post request which takes the user ID as the param and queries
    select * from requests where host == userid
 -
